<p>Nightvision / Thermalvision script for FiveM</p>

## Installation
<p>Right now this script is made for QBCore.</p>
<p>So you will need to add following to your items.lua</p>

<p>Right now the only configuarble thing is the items inside `Config.lua`</p>
<p>I will work on creating the `Config.ini` later on.</p>
